# vssbackuphelper

This program only for Windows Vista or higer. Support for Windows XP in plans, but not a priority since it's out of date. This program will never work on older windows such as 2000, since there is no shadow copy service there. For the same reason, the program does not work with fat32/16 volumes, probably you can use dd or ntfsclone for windows in such cases.

For build this project you need qmake 4 with msvc2008 or higher. For example qt4 for visual studio 2008. I just like qt-creator and i dont have a visual studio instalation on my old pc, if you can buil it with windows sdk only, please tell me how :)
